## onyxLocksystem

### This script has been abandoned and will not receive anymore updates. Working on an entirely new system.

Onyx Locksystem is a car key lock system with additional features, you must have the keys to drive the car you are currently sitting in, if you don't have the keys you can either hotwire or search for the keys.

The key system can be used in other scripts to give players keys from other scripts, you'll probably want to use it in your garage script and car dealership script.

Requires: [ProgressBars](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-progress-bars-1-0-standalone/526287)

# Features
* Locking/Unlocking vehicles with keys
* Hotwiring vehicles with multiple stages
* Searching the glovebox with a chance to find spare keys
* Synced with the server so players cant spam abuse searching the same car
* Stores the vehicles plate to check if players have keys for the car with that plate

I plan to update this over time adding more features to the script, such as lockpicking vehicle doors and smoother animations.

# Use
`exports["onyxLocksystem"]:givePlayerKeys(plate)`
